* 6. 对象操作

本章介绍了针对各种对象的操作，包括列表，数字，字符，字符串，向量，字节向量，符号，布尔值，哈希表，以及枚举类型。第一节涵盖了常量对象和引用。第二节介绍了用于比较两个对象的通用等价性谓词，及判定对象类型的谓词。随后的几节介绍了主要用于处理上述某一类型对象的过程。本章中没有介绍过程操作的内容，因为唯一一个专门为过程定义的操作是 application, 而它已经在第 5 章中介绍过了。端口操作在第 7 章关于输入输出的更一般性的讨论中会介绍。定义新数据类型的机制会在第 9 章中介绍。

** Section 6.1. Constants 和 Quotation

syntax: constant

returns: constant


~constant~ 是任何自求值常量，即，数字，布尔值，字符，字符串，或字节向量。常量是不可变的；参见下文对引用的介绍的注解。

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme

  #vu8(3 4 5) => #vu8(3 4 5)
#+END_SRC


syntax: (quote obj)

syntax: 'obj

returns: obj

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


'obj 等价于 (quote obj). Scheme 读取器（参见“读取”）会把缩写形式转化为完整形式。

quote 阻止了对 obj 的常规求值规则，允许 obj 被作为数据使用。虽然任何 Scheme 对象都可以被引用，但没必要引用自求值常量，即，数字，布尔值，字符，字符串和字节向量。

Quoted 和 self-evaluating constants are immutable. That is, programs should not alter a constant via set-car!, string-set!, etc., 和 implementations are permitted to raise an exception with condition type &assertion if such an alteration is attempted. If an attempt to alter an immutable object is undetected, the behavior of the program is unspecified. An implementation may choose to share storage among different constants to save space.
引用的和自求值的常量是不可变的。即，程序不应通过 set-car!, string-set! 等过程修改常量，如果尝试做出这种修改，具体实现可以抛出一个条件类型的 &assertion 异常。如果修改不可变对象的尝试没有被检测到，程序的行为就会不可知。一种实现可以选择使不同的常量共享存储以节省空间。

syntax: (quasiquote obj ...)

syntax: `obj

syntax: (unquote obj ...)

syntax: ,obj

syntax: (unquote-splicing obj ...)

syntax: ,@obj

returns: see below

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


`obj 等价于 (quasiquote obj), ,obj 等价于 (unquote obj), 而 ,@obj 等价于 (unquote-splicing obj). Scheme 读取器（参见“读取”）会把缩写形式转化为完整形式。

quasiquote 类似于 quote, 但它允许引用内容的一部分被解除引用。在一个 quasiquote 表达式中，unquote 和 unquote-splicing 衍生形式被求值，而其它一切内容都是引用的，即，保留为未求值的。每个 unquote 衍生形式的值会替换掉 unquote 形式，插入到输出中，而每个 unquote-splicing 衍生形式的值会被拼接进外围的列表或向量结构中。unquote 和 unquote-splicing 只在 quasiquote 表达式中有效。

quasiquote 表达式可以嵌套，expressions may be nested, with each quasiquote introducing a new level of quotation 和 each unquote or unquote-splicing taking away a level of quotation. An expression nested within n quasiquote expressions must be within n unquote or unquote-splicing expressions to be evaluated.

`(+ 2 3) => (+ 2 3)

`(+ 2 ,(* 3 4)) => (+ 2 12)
`(a b (,(+ 2 3) c) d) => (a b (5 c) d)
`(a b ,(reverse '(c d e)) f g) => (a b (e d c) f g)
(let ([a 1] [b 2])
  `(,a . ,b)) => (1 . 2)

`(+ ,@(cdr '(* 2 3))) => (+ 2 3)
`(a b ,@(reverse '(c d e)) f g) => (a b e d c f g)
(let ([a 1] [b 2])
  `(,a ,@b)) => (1 . 2)
`#(,@(list 1 2 3)) => #(1 2 3)

'`,(cons 'a 'b) => `,(cons 'a 'b)
`',(cons 'a 'b) => '(a . b)

unquote 和 unquote-splicing forms with zero or more than one subform are valid only in splicing (list or vector) contexts. (unquote obj ...) 等价于 (unquote obj) ..., 和 (unquote-splicing obj ...) 等价于 (unquote-splicing obj) .... These forms are primarily useful as intermediate forms in the output of the quasiquote exp 和 er. They support certain useful nested quasiquotation idioms [3], such as ,@,@, which has the effect of a doubly indirect splicing when used within a doubly nested 和 doubly evaluated quasiquote expression.

`(a (unquote) b) => (a b)
`(a (unquote (+ 3 3)) b) => (a 6 b)
`(a (unquote (+ 3 3) (* 3 3)) b) => (a 6 9 b)

(let ([x '(m n)]) ``(a ,@,@x f)) => `(a (unquote-splicing m n) f)
(let ([x '(m n)])
  (eval `(let ([m '(b c)] [n '(d e)]) `(a ,@,@x f))
        (environment '(rnrs)))) => (a b c d e f)

unquote 和 unquote-splicing are auxiliary keywords for quasiquote. It is a syntax violation to reference these identifiers except in contexts where they are recognized as auxiliary keywords.

** Section 6.2. Generic Equivalence 和 Type Predicates

This section describes the basic Scheme predicates (procedures returning one of the boolean values #t or #f) for determining the type of an object or the equivalence of two objects. The equivalence predicates eq?, eqv?, 和 equal? are discussed first, followed by the type predicates.

procedure: (eq? obj1 obj2)

returns: #t if obj1 和 obj2 are identical, #f otherwise

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


In most Scheme systems, two objects are considered identical if they are represented internally by the same pointer value 和 distinct (not identical) if they are represented internally by different pointer values, although other criteria, such as time-stamping, are possible.

Although the particular rules for object identity vary somewhat from system to system, the following rules always hold.

    Two objects of different types (booleans, the empty list, pairs, numbers, characters, strings, vectors, symbols, 和 procedures) are distinct.

    Two objects of the same type with different contents or values are distinct.

    The boolean object #t is identical to itself wherever it appears, 和 #f is identical to itself wherever it appears, but #t 和 #f are distinct.

    The empty list () is identical to itself wherever it appears.

    Two symbols are identical if 和 only if they have the same name (by string=?).

    A constant pair, vector, string, or bytevector is identical to itself, as is a pair, vector, string, or bytevector created by an application of cons, vector, string, make-bytevector, etc. Two pairs, vectors, strings, or bytevectors created by different applications of cons, vector, string, make-bytevector, etc., are distinct. One consequence is that cons, for example, may be used to create a unique object distinct from all other objects.

    Two procedures that may behave differently are distinct. A procedure created by an evaluation of a lambda expression is identical to itself. Two procedures created by the same lambda expression at different times, or by similar lambda expressions, may or may not be distinct. 

eq? cannot be used to compare numbers 和 characters reliably. Although every inexact number is distinct from every exact number, two exact numbers, two inexact numbers, or two characters with the same value may or may not be identical.

Since constant objects are immutable, i.e., programs should not modify them via vector-set!, set-car!, or any other structure mutation operation, all or portions of different quoted constants or self-evaluating literals may be represented internally by the same object. Thus, eq? may return #t when applied to equal parts of different immutable constants.

eq? is most often used to compare symbols or to check for pointer equivalence of allocated objects, e.g., pairs, vectors, or record instances.

  (eq? (f 0) (f 0))) => #f

procedure: (eqv? obj1 obj2)

returns: #t if obj1 和 obj2 are equivalent, #f otherwise

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


eqv? 类似于 eq? except eqv? is guaranteed to return #t for two characters that are considered equal by char=? 和 two numbers that are (a) considered equal by = 和 (b) cannot be distinguished by any other operation besides eq? 和 eqv?. A consequence of (b) is that (eqv? -0.0 +0.0) is #f even though (= -0.0 +0.0) is #t in systems that distinguish -0.0 和 +0.0, such as those based on IEEE floating-point arithmetic. This is because operations such as / can expose the difference:

(/ 1.0 -0.0) => -inf.0
(/ 1.0 +0.0) => +inf.0

Similarly, although 3.0 和 3.0+0.0i are considered numerically equal, they are not considered equivalent by eqv? if -0.0 和 0.0 have different representations.

(= 3.0+0.0i 3.0) => #t
(eqv? 3.0+0.0i 3.0) => #f

The boolean value returned by eqv? is not specified when the arguments are NaNs.

(eqv? +nan.0 (/ 0.0 0.0)) => unspecified

eqv? is less implementation-dependent but generally more expensive than eq?.

procedure: (equal? obj1 obj2)

returns: #t if obj1 和 obj2 have the same structure 和 contents, #f otherwise

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


Two objects are equal if they are equivalent according to eqv?, strings that are string=?, bytevectors that are bytevector=?, pairs whose cars 和 cdrs are equal, or vectors of the same length whose corresponding elements are equal.

equal? is required to terminate even for cyclic arguments 和 return #t "if 和 only if the (possibly infinite) unfoldings of its arguments into regular trees are equal as ordered trees" [24]. In essence, two values are equivalent, in the sense of equal?, if the structure of the two objects cannot be distinguished by any composition of pair 和 vector accessors along with the eqv?, string=?, 和 bytevector=? procedures for comparing data at the leaves.

Implementing equal? efficiently is tricky [1], 和 even with a good implementation, it is likely to be more expensive than either eqv? or eq?.

These predicates form a hierarchy: any integer is rational, any rational is real, any real is complex, 和 any complex is numeric. Most implementations do not provide internal representations for irrational numbers, so all real numbers are typically rational as well.

returns: #t if obj is a hashtable, #f otherwise

libraries: (rnrs hashtables), (rnrs)


(hashtable? (make-eq-hashtable)) => #t
(hashtable? '(not a hash table)) => #f

** Section 6.3. Lists 和 Pairs

The pair, or cons cell, is the most fundamental of Scheme's structured object types. The most common use for pairs is to build lists, which are ordered sequences of pairs linked one to the next by the cdr field. The elements of the list occupy the car fields of the pairs. The cdr of the last pair in a proper list is the empty list, (); the cdr of the last pair in an improper list can be anything other than ().

Pairs may be used to construct binary trees. Each pair in the tree structure is an internal node of the binary tree; its car 和 cdr are the children of the node.

Proper lists are printed as sequences of objects separated by whitespace 和 enclosed in parentheses. Matching pairs of brackets ( [ ] ) may be used in place of parentheses. For example, (1 2 3) 和 (a [nested list]) are proper lists. The empty list is written as ().

Improper lists 和 trees require a slightly more complex syntax. A single pair is written as two objects separated by whitespace 和 a dot, e.g., (a . b). This is referred to as dotted-pair notation. Improper lists 和 trees are also written in dotted-pair notation; the dot appears wherever necessary, e.g., (1 2 3 . 4) or ((1 . 2) . 3). Proper lists may be written in dotted-pair notation as well. For example, (1 2 3) may be written as (1 . (2 . (3 . ()))).

It is possible to create a circular list or a cyclic graph by destructively altering the car or cdr field of a pair, using set-car! or set-cdr!. Such lists are not considered proper lists.

Procedures that accept a list argument are required to detect that the list is improper only to the extent that they actually traverse the list far enough either (a) to attempt to operate on a non-list tail or (b) to loop indefinitely due to a circularity. For example, member need not detect that a list is improper if it actually finds the element being sought, 和 list-ref need never detect circularities, because its recursion is bounded by the index argument.

procedure: (cons obj1 obj2)

returns: a new pair whose car 和 cdr are obj1 和 obj2

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


cons is the pair constructor procedure. obj1 becomes the car 和 obj2 becomes the cdr of the new pair.

(cons 'a '()) => (a)
(cons 'a '(b c)) => (a b c)
(cons 3 4) => (3 . 4)

procedure: (car pair)

returns: the car of pair

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


The empty list is not a pair, so the argument must not be the empty list.

(car '(a)) => a
(car '(a b c)) => a
(car (cons 3 4)) => 3

procedure: (cdr pair)

returns: the cdr of pair

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


The empty list is not a pair, so the argument must not be the empty list.

(cdr '(a)) => ()
(cdr '(a b c)) => (b c)
(cdr (cons 3 4)) => 4

procedure: (set-car! pair obj)

returns: unspecified

libraries: (rnrs mutable-pairs)


set-car! changes the car of pair to obj.

(let ([x (list 'a 'b 'c)])
  (set-car! x 1)
  x) => (1 b c)

procedure: (set-cdr! pair obj)

returns: unspecified

libraries: (rnrs mutable-pairs)


set-cdr! changes the cdr of pair to obj.

(let ([x (list 'a 'b 'c)])
  (set-cdr! x 1)
  x) => (a . 1)

procedure: (caar pair)

procedure: (cadr pair) =>

procedure: (cddddr pair)

returns: the caar, cadr, ..., or cddddr of pair

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


These procedures are defined as the composition of up to four cars 和 cdrs. The a's 和 d's between the c 和 r represent the application of car or cdr in order from right to left. For example, the procedure cadr applied to a pair yields the car of the cdr of the pair 和 等价于 (lambda (x) (car (cdr x))).

(caar '((a))) => a
(cadr '(a b c)) => b
(cdddr '(a b c d)) => (d)
(cadadr '(a (b c))) => c

procedure: (list obj ...)

returns: a list of obj ...

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


list 等价于 (lambda x x).

(list) => ()
(list 1 2 3) => (1 2 3)
(list 3 2 1) => (3 2 1)

procedure: (cons* obj ... final-obj)

returns: a list of obj ... terminated by final-obj

libraries: (rnrs lists), (rnrs)


If the objects obj ... are omitted, the result is simply final-obj. Otherwise, a list of obj ... is constructed, as with list, except that the final cdr field is final-obj instead of (). If final-obj is not a list, the result is an improper list.

(cons* '()) => ()
(cons* '(a b)) => (a b)
(cons* 'a 'b 'c) => (a b . c)
(cons* 'a 'b '(c d)) => (a b c d)

procedure: (list? obj)

returns: #t if obj is a proper list, #f otherwise

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


list? must return #f for all improper lists, including cyclic lists. A definition of list? is shown on page 67.

(list? '()) => #t
(list? '(a b c)) => #t
(list? 'a) => #f
(list? '(3 . 4)) => #f
(list? 3) => #f
(let ([x (list 'a 'b 'c)])
  (set-cdr! (cddr x) x)
  (list? x)) => #f

procedure: (length list)

returns: the number of elements in list

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


length may be defined as follows, using an adaptation of the hare 和 tortoise algorithm used for the definition of list? on page 67.

(define length
  (lambda (x)
    (define improper-list
      (lambda ()
        (assertion-violation 'length "not a proper list" x)))

    (let f ([h x] [t x] [n 0])
      (if (pair? h)
          (let ([h (cdr h)])
            (if (pair? h)
                (if (eq? h t)
                    (improper-list)
                    (f (cdr h) (cdr t) (+ n 2)))
                (if (null? h)
                    (+ n 1)
                    (improper-list))))
          (if (null? h)
              n
              (improper-list))))))

(length '()) => 0
(length '(a b c)) => 3
(length '(a b . c)) => exception
(length
  (let ([ls (list 'a 'b)])
    (set-cdr! (cdr ls) ls) => exception
    ls))
(length
  (let ([ls (list 'a 'b)])
    (set-car! (cdr ls) ls) => 2
    ls))

procedure: (list-ref list n)

returns: the nth element (zero-based) of list

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


n must be an exact nonnegative integer less than the length of list. list-ref may be defined without error checks as follows.

(define list-ref
  (lambda (ls n)
    (if (= n 0)
        (car ls)
        (list-ref (cdr ls) (- n 1)))))

(list-ref '(a b c) 0) => a
(list-ref '(a b c) 1) => b
(list-ref '(a b c) 2) => c

procedure: (list-tail list n)

returns: the nth tail (zero-based) of list

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


n must be an exact nonnegative integer less than or equal to the length of list. The result is not a copy; the tail is eq? to the nth cdr of list (or to list itself, if n is zero).

list-tail may be defined without error checks as follows.

(define list-tail
  (lambda (ls n)
    (if (= n 0)
        ls
        (list-tail (cdr ls) (- n 1)))))

(list-tail '(a b c) 0) => (a b c)
(list-tail '(a b c) 2) => (c)
(list-tail '(a b c) 3) => ()
(list-tail '(a b c . d) 2) => (c . d)
(list-tail '(a b c . d) 3) => d
(let ([x (list 1 2 3)])
  (eq? (list-tail x 2)
       (cddr x))) => #t

procedure: (append)

procedure: (append list ... obj)

returns: the concatenation of the input lists

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


append returns a new list consisting of the elements of the first list followed by the elements of the second list, the elements of the third list, 和 so on. The new list is made from new pairs for all arguments but the last; the last (which need not be a list) is merely placed at the end of the new structure. append may be defined without error checks as follows.

(define append
  (lambda args
    (let f ([ls '()] [args args])
      (if (null? args)
          ls
          (let g ([ls ls])
            (if (null? ls)
                (f (car args) (cdr args))
                (cons (car ls) (g (cdr ls)))))))))

(append '(a b c) '()) => (a b c)
(append '() '(a b c)) => (a b c)
(append '(a b) '(c d)) => (a b c d)
(append '(a b) 'c) => (a b . c)
(let ([x (list 'b)])
  (eq? x (cdr (append '(a) x)))) => #t

procedure: (reverse list)

returns: a new list containing the elements of list in reverse order

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


reverse may be defined without error checks as follows.

(define reverse
  (lambda (ls)
    (let rev ([ls ls] [new '()])
      (if (null? ls)
          new
          (rev (cdr ls) (cons (car ls) new))))))

(reverse '()) => ()
(reverse '(a b c)) => (c b a)

procedure: (memq obj list)

procedure: (memv obj list)

procedure: (member obj list)

returns: the first tail of list whose car 等价于 obj, or #f

libraries: (rnrs lists), (rnrs)


These procedures traverse the argument list in order, comparing the elements of list against obj. If an object equivalent to obj is found, the tail of the list whose first element is that object is returned. If the list contains more than one object equivalent to obj, the first tail whose first element 等价于 obj is returned. If no object equivalent to obj is found, #f is returned. The equivalence test for memq is eq?, for memv is eqv?, 和 for member is equal?.

These procedures are most often used as predicates, but their names do not end with a question mark because they return a useful true value in place of #t. memq may be defined without error checks as follows.

(define memq
  (lambda (x ls)
    (cond
      [(null? ls) #f]
      [(eq? (car ls) x) ls]
      [else (memq x (cdr ls))])))

memv 和 member may be defined similarly, with eqv? 和 equal? in place of eq?.

(memq 'a '(b c a d e)) => (a d e)
(memq 'a '(b c d e g)) => #f
(memq 'a '(b a c a d a)) => (a c a d a)

(memv 3.4 '(1.2 2.3 3.4 4.5)) => (3.4 4.5)
(memv 3.4 '(1.3 2.5 3.7 4.9)) => #f
(let ([ls (list 'a 'b 'c)])
  (set-car! (memv 'b ls) 'z)
  ls) => (a z c)

(member '(b) '((a) (b) (c))) => ((b) (c))
(member '(d) '((a) (b) (c))) => #f
(member "b" '("a" "b" "c")) => ("b" "c")

(let ()
  (define member?
    (lambda (x ls)
      (和 (member x ls) #t)))
  (member? '(b) '((a) (b) (c)))) => #t

(define count-occurrences
  (lambda (x ls)
    (cond
      [(memq x ls) =>
       (lambda (ls)
         (+ (count-occurrences x (cdr ls)) 1))]
      [else 0])))

(count-occurrences 'a '(a b c d a)) => 2

procedure: (memp procedure list)

returns: the first tail of list for whose car procedure returns true, or #f

libraries: (rnrs lists), (rnrs)


procedure should accept one argument 和 return a single value. It should not modify list.

(memp odd? '(1 2 3 4)) => (1 2 3 4)
(memp even? '(1 2 3 4)) => (2 3 4)
(let ([ls (list 1 2 3 4)])
  (eq? (memp odd? ls) ls)) => #t
(let ([ls (list 1 2 3 4)])
  (eq? (memp even? ls) (cdr ls))) => #t
(memp odd? '(2 4 6 8)) => #f

procedure: (remq obj list)

procedure: (remv obj list)

procedure: (remove obj list)

returns: a list containing the elements of list with all occurrences of obj removed

libraries: (rnrs lists), (rnrs)


These procedures traverse the argument list, removing any objects that are equivalent to obj. The elements remaining in the output list are in the same order as they appear in the input list. If a tail of list (including list itself) contains no occurrences of obj, the corresponding tail of the result list may be the same (by eq?) as the tail of the input list.

The equivalence test for remq is eq?, for remv is eqv?, 和 for remove is equal?.

(remq 'a '(a b a c a d)) => (b c d)
(remq 'a '(b c d)) => (b c d)

(remv 1/2 '(1.2 1/2 0.5 3/2 4)) => (1.2 0.5 3/2 4)

(remove '(b) '((a) (b) (c))) => ((a) (c))

procedure: (remp procedure list)

returns: a list of the elements of list for which procedure returns #f

libraries: (rnrs lists), (rnrs)


procedure should accept one argument 和 return a single value. It should not modify list.

remp applies procedure to each element of list 和 returns a list containing only the elements for which procedure returns #f. The elements of the returned list appear in the same order as they appeared in the original list.

(remp odd? '(1 2 3 4)) => (2 4)
(remp
  (lambda (x) (和 (> x 0) (< x 10)))
  '(-5 15 3 14 -20 6 0 -9)) => (-5 15 14 -20 0 -9)

procedure: (filter procedure list)

returns: a list of the elements of list for which procedure returns true

libraries: (rnrs lists), (rnrs)


procedure should accept one argument 和 return a single value. It should not modify list.

filter applies procedure to each element of list 和 returns a new list containing only the elements for which procedure returns true. The elements of the returned list appear in the same order as they appeared in the original list.

(filter odd? '(1 2 3 4)) => (1 3)
(filter
  (lambda (x) (和 (> x 0) (< x 10)))
  '(-5 15 3 14 -20 6 0 -9)) => (3 6)

procedure: (partition procedure list)

returns: see below

libraries: (rnrs lists), (rnrs)


procedure should accept one argument 和 return a single value. It should not modify list.

partition applies procedure to each element of list 和 returns two values: a new list containing only the elements for which procedure returns true, 和 a new list containing only the elements for which procedure returns #f. The elements of the returned lists appear in the same order as they appeared in the original list.

(partition odd? '(1 2 3 4)) => (1 3)
                             (2 4)
(partition
  (lambda (x) (和 (> x 0) (< x 10)))
  '(-5 15 3 14 -20 6 0 -9)) => (3 6)
                             (-5 15 14 -20 0 -9)

The values returned by partition can be obtained by calling filter 和 remp separately, but this would require two calls to procedure for each element of list.

procedure: (find procedure list)

returns: the first element of list for which procedure returns true, or #f

libraries: (rnrs lists), (rnrs)


procedure should accept one argument 和 return a single value. It should not modify list.

find traverses the argument list in order, applying procedure to each element in turn. If procedure returns a true value for a given element, find returns that element without applying procedure to the remaining elements. If procedure returns #f for each element of list, find returns #f.

If a program must distinguish between finding #f in the list 和 finding no element at all, memp should be used instead.

(find odd? '(1 2 3 4)) => 1
(find even? '(1 2 3 4)) => 2
(find odd? '(2 4 6 8)) => #f
(find not '(1 a #f 55)) => #f

procedure: (assq obj alist)

procedure: (assv obj alist)

procedure: (assoc obj alist)

returns: first element of alist whose car 等价于 obj, or #f

libraries: (rnrs lists), (rnrs)


The argument alist must be an association list. An association list is a proper list whose elements are key-value pairs of the form (key . value). Associations are useful for storing information (values) associated with certain objects (keys).

These procedures traverse the association list, testing each key for equivalence with obj. If an equivalent key is found, the key-value pair is returned. Otherwise, #f is returned.

The equivalence test for assq is eq?, for assv is eqv?, 和 for assoc is equal?. assq may be defined without error checks as follows.

(define assq
  (lambda (x ls)
    (cond
      [(null? ls) #f]
      [(eq? (caar ls) x) (car ls)]
      [else (assq x (cdr ls))])))

assv 和 assoc may be defined similarly, with eqv? 和 equal? in place of eq?.

(assq 'b '((a . 1) (b . 2))) => (b . 2)
(cdr (assq 'b '((a . 1) (b . 2)))) => 2
(assq 'c '((a . 1) (b . 2))) => #f

(assv 2/3 '((1/3 . 1) (2/3 . 2))) => (2/3 . 2)
(assv 2/3 '((1/3 . a) (3/4 . b))) => #f

(assoc '(a) '(((a) . a) (-1 . b))) => ((a) . a)
(assoc '(a) '(((b) . b) (a . c))) => #f

(let ([alist (list (cons 2 'a) (cons 3 'b))])
  (set-cdr! (assv 3 alist) 'c)
  alist) => ((2 . a) (3 . c))

The interpreter given in Section 12.7 represents environments as association lists 和 uses assq for both variable lookup 和 assignment.

procedure: (assp procedure alist)

returns: first element of alist for whose car procedure returns true, or #f

libraries: (rnrs lists), (rnrs)


alist must be an association list. An association list is a proper list whose elements are key-value pairs of the form (key . value). procedure should accept one argument 和 return a single value. It should not modify list.

(assp odd? '((1 . a) (2 . b))) => (1 . a)
(assp even? '((1 . a) (2 . b))) => (2 . b)
(let ([ls (list (cons 1 'a) (cons 2 'b))])
  (eq? (assp odd? ls) (car ls))) => #t
(let ([ls (list (cons 1 'a) (cons 2 'b))])
  (eq? (assp even? ls) (cadr ls))) => #t
(assp odd? '((2 . b))) => #f

procedure: (list-sort predicate list)

returns: a list containing the elements of list sorted according to predicate

libraries: (rnrs sorting), (rnrs)


predicate should be a procedure that expects two arguments 和 returns #t if its first argument must precede its second in the sorted list. That is, if predicate is applied to two elements x 和 y, where x appears after y in the input list, it should return true only if x should appear before y in the output list. If this constraint is met, list-sort performs a stable sort, i.e., two elements are reordered only when necessary according to predicate. Duplicate elements are not removed. This procedure may call predicate up to nlogn times, where n is the length of list.

(list-sort < '(3 4 2 1 2 5)) => (1 2 2 3 4 5)
(list-sort > '(0.5 1/2)) => (0.5 1/2)
(list-sort > '(1/2 0.5)) => (1/2 0.5)
(list->string
  (list-sort char>?
    (string->list "hello"))) => "ollhe"

** Section 6.4. Numbers

Scheme numbers may be classified as integers, rational numbers, real numbers, or complex numbers. This classification is hierarchical, in that all integers are rational, all rational numbers are real, 和 all real numbers are complex. The predicates integer?, rational?, real?, 和 complex? described in Section 6.2 are used to determine into which of these classes a number falls.

A Scheme number may also be classified as exact or inexact, depending upon the quality of operations used to derive the number 和 the inputs to these operations. The predicates exact? 和 inexact? may be used to determine the exactness of a number. Most operations on numbers in Scheme are exactness preserving: if given exact oper 和 s they return exact values, 和 if given inexact oper 和 s or a combination of exact 和 inexact oper 和 s they return inexact values.

Exact integer 和 rational arithmetic is typically supported to arbitrary precision; the size of an integer or of the denominator or numerator of a ratio is limited only by system storage constraints. Although other representations are possible, inexact numbers are typically represented by floating-point numbers supported by the host computer's hardware or by system software. Complex numbers are typically represented as ordered pairs (real-part, imag-part), where real-part 和 imag-part are exact integers, exact rationals, or floating-point numbers.

Scheme numbers are written in a straightforward manner not much different from ordinary conventions for writing numbers. An exact integer is normally written as a sequence of numerals preceded by an optional sign. For example, 3, +19, -100000, 和 208423089237489374 all represent exact integers.

An exact rational number is normally written as two sequences of numerals separated by a slash (/) 和 preceded by an optional sign. For example, 3/4, -6/5, 和 1/1208203823 are all exact rational numbers. A ratio is reduced immediately to lowest terms when it is read 和 may in fact reduce to an exact integer.

Inexact real numbers are normally written in either floating-point or scientific notation. Floating-point notation consists of a sequence of numerals followed by a decimal point 和 another sequence of numerals, all preceded by an optional sign. Scientific notation consists of an optional sign, a sequence of numerals, an optional decimal point followed by a second string of numerals, 和 an exponent; an exponent is written as the letter e followed by an optional sign 和 a sequence of numerals. For example, 1.0 和 -200.0 are valid inexact integers, 和 1.5, 0.034, -10e-10 和 1.5e-5 are valid inexact rational numbers. The exponent is the power of ten by which the number preceding the exponent should be scaled, so that 2e3 等价于 2000.0.

A mantissa width |w may appear as the suffix of a real number or the real components of a complex number written in floating-point or scientific notation. The mantissa width w represents the number of significant bits in the representation of the number. The mantissa width defaults to 53, the number of significant bits in a normalized IEEE double floating-point number, or more. For denormalized IEEE double floating-point numbers, the mantissa width is less than 53. If an implementation cannot represent a number with the mantissa width specified, it uses a representation with at least as many significant bits as requested if possible, otherwise it uses its representation with the largest mantissa width.

Exact 和 inexact real numbers are written as exact or inexact integers or rational numbers; no provision is made in the syntax of Scheme numbers for nonrational real numbers, i.e., irrational numbers.

Complex numbers may be written in either rectangular or polar form. In rectangular form, a complex number is written as x+yi or x-yi, where x is an integer, rational, or real number 和 y is an unsigned integer, rational, or real number. The real part, x, may be omitted, in which case it is assumed to be zero. For example, 3+4i, 3.2-3/4i, +i, 和 -3e-5i are complex numbers written in rectangular form. In polar form, a complex number is written as x@y, where x 和 y are integer, rational, or real numbers. For example, 1.1@1.764 和 -1@-1/2 are complex numbers written in polar form.

The syntaxes +inf.0 和 -inf.0 represent inexact real numbers that represent positive 和 negative infinity. The syntaxes +nan.0 和 -nan.0 represent an inexact "not-a-number" (NaN) value. Infinities may be produced by dividing inexact positive 和 negative values by inexact zero, 和 NaNs may also be produced by dividing inexact zero by inexact zero, among other ways.

The exactness of a numeric representation may be overridden by preceding the representation by either #e or #i. #e forces the number to be exact, 和 #i forces it to be inexact. For example, 1, #e1, 1/1, #e1/1, #e1.0, 和 #e1e0 all represent the exact integer 1, 和 #i3/10, 0.3, #i0.3, 和 3e-1 all represent the inexact rational 0.3.

Numbers are written by default in base 10, although the special prefixes #b (binary), #o (octal), #d (decimal), 和 #x (hexadecimal) can be used to specify base 2, base 8, base 10, or base 16. For radix 16, the letters a through f or A through F serve as the additional numerals required to express digit values 10 through 15. For example, #b10101 is the binary equivalent of 2110, #o72 is the octal equivalent of 5810, 和 #xC7 is the hexadecimal equivalent of 19910. Numbers written in floating-point 和 scientific notations are always written in base 10.

If both are present, radix 和 exactness prefixes may appear in either order.

A Scheme implementation may support more than one size of internal representation for inexact quantities. The exponent markers s (short), f (single), d (double), 和 l (long) may appear in place of the default exponent marker e to override the default size for numbers written in scientific notation. In implementations that support multiple representations, the default size has at least as much precision as double.

A precise grammar for Scheme numbers is given on page 459.

Any number can be written in a variety of different ways, but the system printer (invoked by put-datum, write, 和 display) 和 number->string express numbers in a compact form, using the fewest number of digits necessary to retain the property that, when read, the printed number is identical to the original number.

The remainder of this section describes "generic arithmetic" procedures that operate on numbers. The two sections that follow this section describe operations specific to fixnums 和 flonums, which are representations of exact, fixed-precision integer values 和 inexact real values.

The types of numeric arguments accepted by the procedures in this section are implied by the names given to the arguments: num for complex numbers (that is, all numbers), real for real numbers, rat for rational numbers, 和 int for integers. If a real, rat, or int is required, the argument must be considered real, rational, or integral by real?, rational?, or integer?, i.e., the imaginary part of the number must be exactly zero. Where exact integers are required, the name exint is used. In each case, a suffix may appear on the name, e.g., int2.

procedure: (div-和-mod x1 x2)

returns: see below

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


If x1 和 x2 are exact, x2 must not be zero. These procedures implement number-theoretic integer division, with the div operation being related to quotient 和 the mod operation being related to remainder or modulo, but in both cases extended to h 和 le real numbers.

In situations where the implementation cannot represent the mathematical results prescribed by these equations as a number object, div 和 mod return an unspecified number or raise an exception with condition type &implementation-restriction.

(define (div-和-mod x1 x2) (values (div x1 x2) (mod x1 x2)))

The two's complement representation of a nonnegative number conceptually extends to the left (toward more significant bits) with an infinite number of zero bits, 和 the two's complement representation of a negative number conceptually extends to the left with an infinite number of one bits.

If exint2 is negative, bitwise-arithmetic-shift returns the result of arithmetically shifting exint1 right by -exint2 bits. Otherwise, bitwise-arithmetic-shift returns the result of shifting exint1 left by exint2 bits. exint1 is treated as if represented in two's complement, even if it is not represented that way internally.

procedure: (string->number string)

procedure: (string->number string radix)

returns: the number represented by string, or #f

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


If string is a valid representation of a number, that number is returned, otherwise #f is returned. The number is interpreted in radix radix, which must be an exact integer in the set {2,8,10,16}. If not specified, radix defaults to 10. Any radix specifier within string, e.g., #x, overrides the radix argument.

(string->number "0") => 0

procedure: (number->string num)

procedure: (number->string num radix)

procedure: (number->string num radix precision)

returns: an external representation of num as a string

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


The num is expressed in radix radix, which must be an exact integer in the set {2,8,10,16}. If not specified, radix defaults to 10. In any case, no radix specifier appears in the resulting string.

The external representation is such that, when converted back into a number using string->number, the resulting numeric value 等价于 num. That is, for all inputs:

(eqv? (string->number
        (number->string num radix)
        radix)
      num)

returns #t. An exception with condition type &implementation-restriction is raised if this is not possible.

If precision is provided, it must be an exact positive integer, num must be inexact, 和 radix must be 10. In this case, the real part 和, if present, the imaginary part of the number are each printed with an explicit mantissa width m, where m is the least possible value greater than or equal to precision that makes the expression above true.

If radix is 10, inexact values of num are expressed using the fewest number of significant digits possible [5] without violating the above restriction.

(number->string 3.4) => "3.4"
(number->string 1e2) => "100.0"
(number->string 1e-23) => "1e-23"
(number->string -7/2) => "-7/2"
(number->string 220/9 16) => "DC/9"

** Section 6.5. Fixnums

Fixnums represent exact integers in the fixnum range, which is required to be a closed range [-2w-1,2w-1 - 1], where w (the fixnum width) is at least 24. The implementation-specific value of w may be determined via the procedure fixnum-width, 和 the endpoints of the range may be determined via the procedures least-fixnum 和 greatest-fixnum.

The names of arithmetic procedures that operate only on fixnums begin with the prefix "fx" to set them apart from their generic counterparts.

Procedure arguments required to be fixnums are named fx, possibly with a suffix, e.g., fx2.

Unless otherwise specified, the numeric values of fixnum-specific procedures are fixnums. If the value of a fixnum operation should be a fixnum, but the mathematical result would be outside the fixnum range, an exception with condition type &implementation-restriction is raised.

Bit 和 shift operations on fixnums assume that fixnums are represented in two's complement, even if they are not represented that way internally.

** Section 6.6. Flonums

Flonums represent inexact real numbers. Implementations are required to represent as a flonum any inexact real number whose lexical syntax contains no vertical bar 和 no exponent marker other than e, but are not required to represent any other inexact real number as a flonum.

Implementations typically use the IEEE double-precision floating-point representation for flonums, but implementations are not required to do so or even to use a floating-point representation of any sort, despite the name "flonum."

This section describes operations on flonums. Flonum-specific procedure names begin with the prefix "fl" to set them apart from their generic counterparts.

Procedure arguments required to be flonums are named fl, possibly with suffix, e.g., fl2. Unless otherwise specified, the numeric values of flonum-specific procedures are flonums.

procedure: (flonum? obj)

returns: #t if obj is a flonum, otherwise #f

procedure: (fl>=? fl1 fl2 fl3 ...)

returns: #t if the relation holds, #f otherwise

libraries: (rnrs arithmetic flonums), (rnrs)


The predicate fl=? returns #t if its arguments are equal. The predicate fl<? returns #t if its arguments are monotonically increasing, i.e., each argument is greater than the preceding ones, while fl>? returns #t if its arguments are monotonically decreasing. The predicate fl<=? returns #t if its arguments are monotonically nondecreasing, i.e., each argument is not less than the preceding ones, while fl>=? returns #t if its arguments are monotonically nonincreasing. When passed only one argument, each of these predicates returns #t.

Comparisons involving NaNs always return #f.

flzero? 等价于 (lambda (x) (fl=? x 0.0)), flpositive? 等价于 (lambda (x) (fl>? x 0.0)), 和 flnegative? to (lambda (x) (fl<? x 0.0)).

** Section 6.7. Characters

Characters are atomic objects representing letters, digits, special symbols such as $ or -, 和 certain nongraphic control characters such as space 和 newline. Characters are written with a #\ prefix. For most characters, the prefix is followed by the character itself. The written character representation of the letter A, for example, is #\A. The characters newline, space, 和 tab may be written in this manner as well, but they can be written more clearly as #\newline, #\space, 和 #\tab. Other character names are supported as well, as defined by the grammar for character objects on page 457. Any Unicode character may be written with the syntax #\xn, where n consists of one or more hexadecimal digits 和 represents a valid Unicode scalar value.

This section describes the operations that deal primarily with characters. See also the following section on strings 和 Chapter 7 on input 和 output for other operations relating to characters.

procedure: (char=? char1 char2 char3 ...)

procedure: (char<? char1 char2 char3 ...)

procedure: (char>? char1 char2 char3 ...)

procedure: (char<=? char1 char2 char3 ...)

procedure: (char>=? char1 char2 char3 ...)

returns: #t if the relation holds, #f otherwise

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


These predicates behave in a similar manner to the numeric predicates =, <, >, <=, 和 >=. For example, char=? returns #t when its arguments are equivalent characters, 和 char<? returns #t when its arguments are monotonically increasing character (Unicode scalar) values.

(char>? #\a #\b) => #f
(char<? #\a #\b) => #t
(char<? #\a #\b #\c) => #t

procedure: (char-ci<=? char1 char2 char3 ...)

procedure: (char-ci>=? char1 char2 char3 ...)

libraries: (rnrs unicode), (rnrs)


These predicates are identical to the predicates char=?, char<?, char>?, char<=?, 和 char>=? except that they are case-insensitive, i.e., compare the case-folded versions of their arguments. For example, char=? considers #\a 和 #\A to be distinct values; char-ci=? does not.

(char-ci<? #\a #\B) => #t
(char-ci=? #\W #\w) => #t
(char-ci=? #\= #\+) => #f

Otherwise, if it is not a title-case character, has no single title-case counterpart, but does have a single upper-case counterpart, char-titlecase returns the upper-case counterpart. Otherwise char-titlecase returns char.

(char-titlecase #\g) => #\G

libraries: (rnrs unicode), (rnrs)


If char has a case-folded counterpart, char-foldcase returns the case-folded counterpart. Otherwise, char-foldcase returns char. For most characters, (char-foldcase char) 等价于 (char-downcase (char-upcase char)), but for Turkic İ 和 ı, char-foldcase acts as the identity.

(integer->char 48) => #\0
(integer->char #x3BB) => #\<graphic>

** Section 6.8. Strings

Strings are sequences of characters 和 are often used as messages, character buffers, or containers for blocks of text. Scheme provides operations for creating strings, extracting characters from strings, obtaining substrings, concatenating strings, 和 altering the contents of strings.

A string is written as a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, e.g., "hi there". A double quote may be introduced into a string by preceding it by a backward slash, e.g., "two \"quotes\" within". A backward slash may also be included by preceding it with a backward slash, e.g., "a \\slash". Various special characters can be inserted with other two-character sequences, e.g., \n for newline, \r for carriage return, 和 \t for tab. Any Unicode character may be inserted with the syntax #\xn;, where n consists of one or more hexadecimal digits 和 represents a valid Unicode scalar value. A grammar defining the precise syntax of strings is given on page 458.

Strings are indexed by exact nonnegative integers, 和 the index of the first element of any string is 0. The highest valid index for a given string is one less than its length.

procedure: (string=? string1 string2 string3 ...)

procedure: (string<? string1 string2 string3 ...)

procedure: (string>? string1 string2 string3 ...)

procedure: (string<=? string1 string2 string3 ...)

procedure: (string>=? string1 string2 string3 ...)

returns: #t if the relation holds, #f otherwise

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


As with =, <, >, <=, 和 >=, these predicates express relationships among all of the arguments. For example, string>? determines if the lexicographic ordering of its arguments is monotonically decreasing.

The comparisons are based on the character predicates char=? 和 char<?. Two strings are lexicographically equivalent if they are the same length 和 consist of the same sequence of characters according to char=?. If two strings differ only in length, the shorter string is considered to be lexicographically less than the longer string. Otherwise, the first character position at which the strings differ (by char=?) determines which string is lexicographically less than the other, according to char<?.

Two-argument string=? may be defined without error checks as follows.

(define string=?
  (lambda (s1 s2)
    (let ([n (string-length s1)])
      (和 (= (string-length s2) n)
           (let loop ([i 0])
             (or (= i n)
                 (和 (char=? (string-ref s1 i) (string-ref s2 i))
                      (loop (+ i 1)))))))))

Two-argument string<? may be defined without error checks as follows.

(define string<?
  (lambda (s1 s2)
    (let ([n1 (string-length s1)] [n2 (string-length s2)])
      (let loop ([i 0])

                       (和 (char=? c1 c2)
                            (loop (+ i 1)))))))))))

These definitions may be extended straightforwardly to support three or more arguments. string<=?, string>?, 和 string>=? may be defined similarly.

(string=? "mom" "mom") => #t
(string<? "mom" "mommy") => #t
(string>? "Dad" "Dad") => #f
(string=? "Mom 和 Dad" "mom 和 dad") => #f
(string<? "a" "b" "c") => #t

procedure: (string-ci=? string1 string2 string3 ...)

procedure: (string-ci<? string1 string2 string3 ...)

procedure: (string-ci>? string1 string2 string3 ...)

procedure: (string-ci<=? string1 string2 string3 ...)

procedure: (string-ci>=? string1 string2 string3 ...)

returns: #t if the relation holds, #f otherwise

libraries: (rnrs unicode), (rnrs)


These predicates are identical to string=?, string<?, string>?, string<=?, 和 string>=? except that they are case-insensitive, i.e., compare the case-folded versions of their arguments.

(string-ci=? "Mom 和 Dad" "mom 和 dad") => #t
(string-ci<=? "say what" "Say What!?") => #t

(string #\H #\E #\Y #\!) => "HEY!"

procedure: (make-string n)

procedure: (make-string n char)

returns: a string of length n

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


n must be an exact nonnegative integer. If char is supplied, the string is filled with n occurrences of char, otherwise the characters contained in the string are unspecified.

(make-string 0) => ""
(make-string 0 #\x) => ""
(make-string 5 #\x) => "xxxxx"

procedure: (string-length string)

libraries: (rnrs mutable-strings)


n must be an exact nonnegative integer less than the length of string. string-set! changes the nth element of string to char.

(let ([str (string-copy "hi three")])
  (string-set! str 5 #\e)
  (string-set! str 6 #\r)
  str) => "hi there"

procedure: (string-copy string)

returns: a new copy of string

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


This procedure creates a new string with the same length 和 contents as string.

(string-copy "abc") => "abc"

(let ([str "abc"])
  (eq? str (string-copy str))) => #f

procedure: (string-append string ...)

returns: a new string formed by concatenating the strings string ...

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


(string-append) => ""
(string-append "abc" "def") => "abcdef"
(string-append "Hey " "you " "there!") => "Hey you there!"

The following implementation of string-append recurs down the list of strings to compute the total length, then allocates the new string, then fills it up as it unwinds the recursion.

(define string-append
  (lambda args
    (let f ([ls args] [n 0])
      (if (null? ls)
          (make-string n)
          (let* ([s1 (car ls)]
                 [m (string-length s1)]
                 [s2 (f (cdr ls) (+ n m))])
            (do ([i 0 (+ i 1)] [j n (+ j 1)])
                ((= i m) s2)
              (string-set! s2 j (string-ref s1 i))))))))

procedure: (substring string start end)

returns: a copy of string from start (inclusive) to end (exclusive)

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


start 和 end must be exact nonnegative integers; start must be less than or equal to end, while end must be less than or equal to the length of string. If end = start, a string of length zero is returned. substring may be defined without error checks as follows.

(define substring
  (lambda (s1 m n)
    (let ([s2 (make-string (- n m))])
      (do ([j 0 (+ j 1)] [i m (+ i 1)])

libraries: (rnrs mutable-strings)


string-fill! sets every character in string to char.

(let ([str (string-copy "sleepy")])

  str) => "ZZZZZZ"

string-fill! might be defined as follows:

(define string-fill!

      (do ([i 0 (+ i 1)])
          ((= i n))

procedure: (string-upcase string)

returns: the upper-case equivalent of string

procedure: (string-downcase string)

returns: the lower-case equivalent of string

procedure: (string-foldcase string)

returns: the case-folded equivalent of string

procedure: (string-titlecase string)

returns: the title-case equivalent of string

libraries: (rnrs unicode), (rnrs)


These procedures implement Unicode's locale-independent case mappings from scalar-value sequences to scalar-value sequences. These mappings do not always map single characters to single characters, so the length of the result string may differ from the length of string. If the result string is the same as string (by string=?), string or a copy of string may be returned. Otherwise, the result string is newly allocated. string-foldcase does not use the special mappings for Turkic languages.

string-titlecase converts the first cased character of each word in string to its title-case counterpart 和 converts each other character to its lower-case counterpart. Word breaks are recognized as specified in Unicode St 和 ard Annex #29 [8].

(string-upcase "Hi") => "HI"
(string-downcase "Hi") => "hi"
(string-foldcase "Hi") => "hi"

(string-upcase "Straße") => "STRASSE"
(string-downcase "Straße") => "straße"
(string-foldcase "Straße") => "strasse"
(string-downcase "STRASSE")  => "strasse"

(string-downcase "=>") <graphic> "<graphic>"

(string-titlecase "kNock KNoCK") => "Knock Knock"

(string-normalize-nfd "\xE9;") => "e\x301;"
(string-normalize-nfc "\xE9;") => "\xE9;"
(string-normalize-nfd "\x65;\x301;") => "e\x301;"
(string-normalize-nfc "\x65;\x301;") => "\xE9;"

procedure: (string->list string)

returns: a list of the characters in string

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


string->list allows a string to be converted into a list, so that Scheme's list-processing operations may be applied to the processing of strings. string->list may be defined without error checks as follows.

(define string->list
  (lambda (s)
    (do ([i (- (string-length s) 1) (- i 1)]
         [ls '() (cons (string-ref s i) ls)])
        ((< i 0) ls))))

(string->list "abc") => (#\a #\b #\c)
(apply char<? (string->list "abc")) => #t
(map char-upcase (string->list "abc")) => (#\A #\B #\C)

procedure: (list->string list)

returns: a string of the characters in list

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


list must consist entirely of characters.

list->string is the functional inverse of string->list. A program might use both procedures together, first converting a string into a list, then operating on this list to produce a new list, 和 finally converting the new list back into a string.

list->string may be defined without error checks as follows.

(define list->string
  (lambda (ls)
    (let ([s (make-string (length ls))])
      (do ([ls ls (cdr ls)] [i 0 (+ i 1)])
          ((null? ls) s)
        (string-set! s i (car ls))))))

(list->string '()) => ""
(list->string '(#\a #\b #\c)) => "abc"
(list->string
  (map char-upcase
       (string->list "abc"))) => "ABC"

** Section 6.9. Vectors

Vectors are more convenient 和 efficient than lists for some applications. Whereas accessing an arbitrary element in a list requires a linear traversal of the list up to the selected element, arbitrary vector elements are accessed in constant time. The length of a vector is the number of elements it contains. Vectors are indexed by exact nonnegative integers, 和 the index of the first element of any vector is 0. The highest valid index for a given vector is one less than its length.

As with lists, the elements of a vector can be of any type, 和 a single vector can hold more than one type of object.

A vector is written as a sequence of objects separated by whitespace, preceded by the prefix #( 和 followed by ). For example, a vector consisting of the elements a, b, 和 c would be written #(a b c).

procedure: (vector obj ...)

returns: a vector of the objects obj ...

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


(vector) => #()
(vector 'a 'b 'c) => #(a b c)

procedure: (make-vector n)

procedure: (make-vector n obj)

returns: a vector of length n

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


n must be an exact nonnegative integer. If obj is supplied, each element of the vector is filled with obj; otherwise, the elements are unspecified.

(make-vector 0) => #()
(make-vector 0 '#(a)) => #()
(make-vector 5 '#(a)) => #(#(a) #(a) #(a) #(a) #(a))

procedure: (vector-length vector)

returns: the number of elements in vector

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


The length of a vector is always an exact nonnegative integer.

(vector-length '#()) => 0
(vector-length '#(a b c)) => 3
(vector-length (vector 1 '(2) 3 '#(4 5))) => 4
(vector-length (make-vector 300)) => 300

procedure: (vector-ref vector n)

returns: the nth element (zero-based) of vector

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


n must be an exact nonnegative integer less than the length of vector.

(vector-ref '#(a b c) 0) => a
(vector-ref '#(a b c) 1) => b
(vector-ref '#(x y z w) 3) => w

procedure: (vector-set! vector n obj)

returns: unspecified

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


n must be an exact nonnegative integer less than the length of vector. vector-set! changes the nth element of vector to obj.

(let ([v (vector 'a 'b 'c 'd 'e)])
  (vector-set! v 2 'x)
  v) => #(a b x d e)

procedure: (vector-fill! vector obj)

returns: unspecified

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


vector-fill! replaces each element of vector with obj. It may be defined without error checks as follows.

(define vector-fill!
  (lambda (v x)
    (let ([n (vector-length v)])
      (do ([i 0 (+ i 1)])
          ((= i n))
        (vector-set! v i x)))))

(let ([v (vector 1 2 3)])
  (vector-fill! v 0)
  v) => #(0 0 0)

procedure: (vector->list vector)

returns: a list of the elements of vector

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


vector->list provides a convenient method for applying list-processing operations to vectors. It may be defined without error checks as follows.

(define vector->list
  (lambda (s)
    (do ([i (- (vector-length s) 1) (- i 1)]
         [ls '() (cons (vector-ref s i) ls)])
        ((< i 0) ls))))

(vector->list (vector)) => ()
(vector->list '#(a b c)) => (a b c)

(let ((v '#(1 2 3 4 5)))
  (apply * (vector->list v))) => 120

procedure: (list->vector list)

returns: a vector of the elements of list

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


list->vector is the functional inverse of vector->list. The two procedures are often used in combination to take advantage of a list-processing operation. A vector may be converted to a list with vector->list, this list processed in some manner to produce a new list, 和 the new list converted back into a vector with list->vector.

list->vector may be defined without error checks as follows.

(define list->vector
  (lambda (ls)
    (let ([s (make-vector (length ls))])
      (do ([ls ls (cdr ls)] [i 0 (+ i 1)])
          ((null? ls) s)
        (vector-set! s i (car ls))))))

(list->vector '()) => #()
(list->vector '(a b c)) => #(a b c)

(let ([v '#(1 2 3 4 5)])
  (let ([ls (vector->list v)])
    (list->vector (map * ls ls)))) => #(1 4 9 16 25)

procedure: (vector-sort predicate vector)

returns: a vector containing the elements of vector, sorted according to predicate

procedure: (vector-sort! predicate vector)

returns: unspecified

libraries: (rnrs sorting), (rnrs)


predicate should be a procedure that expects two arguments 和 returns #t if its first argument must precede its second in the sorted vector. That is, if predicate is applied to two elements x 和 y, where x appears after y in the input vector, the predicate should return true only if x should appear before y in the output vector. If this constraint is met, vector-sort performs a stable sort, i.e., two elements are reordered only when necessary according to predicate. vector-sort! performs the sort destructively 和 does not necessarily perform a stable sort. Duplicate elements are not removed. predicate should not have any side effects.

vector-sort may call predicate up to nlogn times, where n is the length of vector, while vector-sort! may call the predicate up to n2 times. The looser bound for vector-sort! allows an implementation to use a quicksort algorithm, which may be faster in some cases than algorithms that have the tighter nlogn bound.

(vector-sort < '#(3 4 2 1 2 5)) => #(1 2 2 3 4 5)
(vector-sort > '#(0.5 1/2)) => #(0.5 1/2)
(vector-sort > '#(1/2 0.5)) => #(1/2 0.5)

(let ([v (vector 3 4 2 1 2 5)])
  (vector-sort! < v)
  v) => #(1 2 2 3 4 5)

** Section 6.10. Bytevectors

Bytevectors are vectors of raw binary data. Although nominally organized as a sequence of exact unsigned 8-bit integers, a bytevector can be interpreted as a sequence of exact signed 8-bit integers, exact signed or unsigned 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, or arbitrary-precision integers, IEEE single or double floating-point numbers, or arbitrary combinations of the above.

The length of a bytevector is the number of 8-bit bytes it stores, 和 indices into a bytevector are always given as byte offsets. Any data element may be aligned at any byte offset, regardless of the underlying hardware's alignment requirements, 和 may be represented using a specified endianness (see below) that differs from that prescribed by the hardware. Special, typically more efficient operators are provided for 16-, 32-, 和 64-bit integers 和 single 和 double floats that are in their native format, i.e,. with the endianness of the underlying hardware 和 stored at an index that is a multiple of the size in bytes of the integer or float.

The endianness of a multi-byte data value determines how it is laid out in memory. In big-endian format, the value is laid out with the more significant bytes at lower indices, while in little-endian format, the value is laid out with the more significant bytes at higher indices. When a bytevector procedure accepts an endianness argument, the argument may be the symbol big, representing the big-endian format, or the symbol little, representing the little-endian format. Implementations may extend these procedures to accept other endianness symbols. The native endianness of the implementation may be obtained via the procedure native-endianness.

Bytevectors are written with the #vu8( prefix in place of the #( prefix for vectors, e.g., #vu8(1 2 3). The elements of a bytevector specified in this manner are always given as 8-bit unsigned exact integers, i.e., integers from 0 to 255 inclusive, written using any valid syntax for such numbers. Like strings, bytevectors are self-evaluating, so they need not be quoted.

'#vu8(1 2 3) => #vu8(1 2 3)
#vu8(1 2 3) => #vu8(1 2 3)
#vu8(#x3f #x7f #xbf #xff) => #vu8(63 127 191 255)

syntax: (endianness symbol)

returns: symbol

libraries: (rnrs bytevectors), (rnrs)


symbol must be the symbol little, the symbol big, or some other symbol recognized by the implementation as an endianness symbol. It is a syntax violation if symbol is not a symbol or if it is not recognized by the implementation as an endianness symbol.

(endianness little) => little
(endianness big) => big
(endianness "spam") => exception

procedure: (native-endianness)

returns: a symbol naming the implementation's native endianness

libraries: (rnrs bytevectors), (rnrs)


The return value is the symbol little, the symbol big, or some other endianness symbol recognized by the implementation. It typically reflects the endianness of the underlying hardware.

(symbol? (native-endianness)) => #t

procedure: (make-bytevector n)

procedure: (make-bytevector n fill)

returns: a new bytevector of length n

libraries: (rnrs bytevectors), (rnrs)


If fill is supplied, each element of the bytevector is initialized to fill; otherwise, the elements are unspecified. The fill value must be a signed or unsigned 8-bit value, i.e., a value in the range -128 to 255 inclusive. A negative fill value is treated as its two's complement equivalent.

(make-bytevector 0) => #vu8()
(make-bytevector 0 7) => #vu8()
(make-bytevector 5 7) => #vu8(7 7 7 7 7)
(make-bytevector 5 -7) => #vu8(249 249 249 249 249)

procedure: (bytevector-length bytevector)

returns: the length of bytevector in 8-bit bytes

libraries: (rnrs bytevectors), (rnrs)


(bytevector-length #vu8()) => 0
(bytevector-length #vu8(1 2 3)) => 3
(bytevector-length (make-bytevector 300)) => 300

procedure: (bytevector=? bytevector1 bytevector2)

returns: #t if the relation holds, #f otherwise

libraries: (rnrs bytevectors), (rnrs)


Two bytevectors are equal by bytevector=? if 和 only if they have the same length 和 same contents.

(bytevector=? #vu8() #vu8()) => #t
(bytevector=? (make-bytevector 3 0) #vu8(0 0 0)) => #t
(bytevector=? (make-bytevector 5 0) #vu8(0 0 0)) => #f
(bytevector=? #vu8(1 127 128 255) #vu8(255 128 127 1)) => #f

procedure: (bytevector-fill! bytevector fill)

returns: unspecified

libraries: (rnrs bytevectors), (rnrs)


The fill value must be a signed or unsigned 8-bit value, i.e., a value in the range -128 to 255 inclusive. A negative fill value is treated as its two's complement equivalent.

bytevector-fill! replaces each element of bytevector with fill.

(let ([v (make-bytevector 6)])
  (bytevector-fill! v 255)
  v) => #vu8(255 255 255 255 255 255)

(let ([v (make-bytevector 6)])
  (bytevector-fill! v -128)
  v) => #vu8(128 128 128 128 128 128)

procedure: (bytevector-copy bytevector)

returns: a new bytevector that is a copy of bytevector

libraries: (rnrs bytevectors), (rnrs)


bytevector-copy creates a new bytevector with the same length 和 contents as bytevector.

(bytevector-copy #vu8(1 127 128 255)) => #vu8(1 127 128 255)

(let ([v #vu8(1 127 128 255)])
  (eq? v (bytevector-copy v))) => #f

procedure: (bytevector-copy! src src-start dst dst-start n)

returns: unspecified

libraries: (rnrs bytevectors), (rnrs)


src 和 dst must be bytevectors. src-start, dst-start, 和 n must be exact nonnegative integers. The sum of src-start 和 n must not exceed the length of src, 和 the sum of dst-start 和 n must not exceed the length of dst.

bytevector-copy! overwrites the n bytes of dst starting at dst-start with the n bytes of src starting at src-start. This works even if dst is the same bytevector as src 和 the source 和 destination locations overlap. That is, the destination is filled with the bytes that appeared at the source before the operation began.

(define v1 #vu8(31 63 95 127 159 191 223 255))
(define v2 (make-bytevector 10 0))

(bytevector-copy! v1 2 v2 1 4)

v2 => #vu8(159 159 191 0 0 191 223 0 191 223)

procedure: (bytevector-u8-ref bytevector n)

returns: the 8-bit unsigned byte at index n (zero-based) of bytevector

procedure: (bytevector-u8-set! bytevector n u8)

returns: unspecified

libraries: (rnrs bytevectors), (rnrs)


n must be an exact nonnegative integer less than the length of bytevector. u8 must be an 8-bit unsigned value, i.e., a value in the range 0 to 255 inclusive.

bytevector-u8-set! changes the 8-bit value at index n (zero-based) of bytevector to u8.

(let ([v (make-bytevector 5 -1)])
  (bytevector-u8-set! v 2 128)
  v) => #vu8(255 255 128 255 255)

The return value is an exact integer in the appropriate range for the number of bytes occupied by the value. Signed values are the equivalent of the stored value treated as a two's complement value.

** Section 6.11. Symbols

Symbols are used for a variety of purposes as symbolic names in Scheme programs. Strings could be used for most of the same purposes, but an important characteristic of symbols makes comparisons between symbols much more efficient. This characteristic is that two symbols with the same name are identical in the sense of eq?. The reason is that the Scheme reader (invoked by get-datum 和 read) 和 the procedure string->symbol catalog symbols in an internal symbol table 和 always return the same symbol whenever the same name is encountered. Thus, no character-by-character comparison is needed, as would be needed to compare two strings.

The property that two symbols may be compared quickly for equivalence makes them ideally suited for use as identifiers in the representation of programs, allowing fast comparison of identifiers. This property also makes symbols useful for a variety of other purposes. For example, symbols might be used as messages passed between procedures, labels for list-structured records, or names for objects stored in an association list (see assq in Section 6.3).

Symbols are written without double quotes or other bracketing characters. Parentheses, double quotes, spaces, 和 most other characters with a special meaning to the Scheme reader are not allowed within the printed representation of a symbol. These 和 any other Unicode character may appear anywhere within the printed representation of a symbol with the syntax #\xn;, where n consists of one or more hexadecimal digits 和 represents a valid Unicode scalar value.

The grammar for symbols on page 458 gives a precise definition of the syntax of symbols.

procedure: (symbol=? symbol1 symbol2)

returns: #t if the two symbols are the same, #f otherwise

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


Symbols can also be compared with eq?, which is typically more efficient than symbol=?.

(symbol=? 'a 'a) => #t
(symbol=? 'a (string->symbol "a")) => #t
(symbol=? 'a 'b) => #f

procedure: (string->symbol string)

returns: a symbol whose name is string

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


string->symbol records all symbols it creates in an internal table that it shares with the system reader. If a symbol whose name 等价于 string (according to the predicate string=?) already exists in the table, this symbol is returned. Otherwise, a new symbol is created with string as its name; this symbol is entered into the table 和 returned.

The effect of modifying a string after it is used as an argument to string->symbol is unspecified.

(string->symbol "x") => x

(eq? (string->symbol "x") 'x) => #t
(eq? (string->symbol "X") 'x) => #f

(eq? (string->symbol "x")
     (string->symbol "x")) => #t

(string->symbol "()") => \x28;\x29;

procedure: (symbol->string symbol)

returns: a string, the name of symbol

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


The string returned by symbol->string should be treated as immutable. Unpredictable behavior can result if a string passed to string->symbol is altered with string-set! or by any other means.

(symbol->string 'xyz) => "xyz"
(symbol->string 'Hi) => "Hi"
(symbol->string (string->symbol "()")) => "()"

** Section 6.12. Booleans

While every Scheme object has a truth value when used in a conditional context, with every object but #f counting as true, Scheme provides the dedicated true value #t for use when a value of an expression should convey nothing more than that it is true.

procedure: (boolean=? boolean1 boolean2)

returns: #t if the two booleans are the same, #f otherwise

libraries: (rnrs base), (rnrs)


The boolean values #t 和 #f may also be compared with eq?, which is typically more efficient than boolean=?.

(boolean=? #t #t) => #t
(boolean=? #t #f) => #f
(boolean=? #t (< 3 4)) => #t

** Section 6.13. Hashtables

Hashtables represent sets of associations between arbitrary Scheme values. They serve essentially the same purpose as association lists (see page  165) but are typically much faster when large numbers of associations are involved.

procedure: (make-eq-hashtable)

procedure: (make-eq-hashtable size)

returns: a new mutable eq hashtable

libraries: (rnrs hashtables), (rnrs)


If size is provided, it must be a nonnegative exact integer indicating approximately how many elements the hashtable should initially hold. Hashtables grow as needed, but when the hashtable grows it generally must rehash all of the existing elements. Providing a nonzero size can help limit the amount of rehashing that must be done as the table is initially populated.

An eq hashtable compares keys using the eq? (pointer equality) procedure 和 typically employs a hash function based on object addresses. Its hash 和 equivalence functions are suitable for any Scheme object.

(define ht1 (make-eq-hashtable))
(define ht2 (make-eq-hashtable 32))

procedure: (make-eqv-hashtable)

procedure: (make-eqv-hashtable size)

returns: a new mutable eqv hashtable

libraries: (rnrs hashtables), (rnrs)


If size is provided, it must be a nonnegative exact integer indicating approximately how many elements the hashtable should initially hold. Hashtables grow as needed, but when the hashtable grows it generally must rehash all of the existing elements. Providing a nonzero size can help limit the amount of rehashing that must be done as the table is initially populated.

An eqv hashtable compares keys using the eqv? procedure 和 typically employs a hash function based on object addresses for objects that are identifiable with eq?. Its hash 和 equivalence functions are suitable for any Scheme object.

procedure: (make-hashtable hash equiv?)

procedure: (make-hashtable hash equiv? size)

returns: a new mutable hashtable

libraries: (rnrs hashtables), (rnrs)


hash 和 equiv? must be procedures. If size is provided, it must be a nonnegative exact integer indicating approximately how many elements the hashtable should initially hold. Hashtables grow as needed, but when the hashtable grows it generally must rehash all of the existing elements. Providing a nonzero size can help limit the amount of rehashing that must be done as the table is initially populated.

The new hashtable computes hash values using hash 和 compares keys using equiv?, neither of which should modify the hashtable. equiv? should compare two keys 和 return false only if the two keys should be distinguished. hash should accept a key as an argument 和 return a nonnegative exact integer value that is the same each time it is called with arguments that equiv? does not distinguish. The hash 和 equiv? procedures need not accept arbitrary inputs as long as the hashtable is used only for keys that they do accept, 和 both procedures may assume that the keys are immutable as long as the keys are not modified while they have associations stored in the table. The hashtable operation may call hash 和 equiv? once, not at all, or multiple times for each hashtable operation.

(define ht (make-hashtable string-hash string=?))

procedure: (hashtable-mutable? hashtable)

returns: #t if hashtable is mutable, #f otherwise

libraries: (rnrs hashtables), (rnrs)


Hashtables returned by one of the hashtable creation procedures above are mutable, but those created by hashtable-copy may be immutable. Immutable hashtables cannot be altered by any of the procedures hashtable-set!, hashtable-update!, hashtable-delete!, or hashtable-clear!.

(hashtable-mutable? (make-eq-hashtable)) => #t
(hashtable-mutable? (hashtable-copy (make-eq-hashtable))) => #f

procedure: (hashtable-hash-function hashtable)

returns: the hash function associated with hashtable

procedure: (hashtable-equivalence-function hashtable)

returns: the equivalence function associated with hashtable

libraries: (rnrs hashtables), (rnrs)


hashtable-hash-function returns #f for eq 和 eqv hashtables.

(define ht (make-eq-hashtable))
(hashtable-hash-function ht) => #f
(eq? (hashtable-equivalence-function ht) eq?) => #t

(define ht (make-hashtable string-hash string=?))
(eq? (hashtable-hash-function ht) string-hash) => #t
(eq? (hashtable-equivalence-function ht) string=?) => #t

procedure: (equal-hash obj)

procedure: (string-hash string)

procedure: (string-ci-hash string)

procedure: (symbol-hash symbol)

returns: an exact nonnegative integer hash value

libraries: (rnrs hashtables), (rnrs)


These procedures are hash functions suitable for use with the appropriate Scheme predicate: equal? for equal-hash, string=? for string-hash, string-ci=? for string-ci-hash, 和 symbol=? (or eq?) for symbol-hash. The hash values returned by equal-hash, string-hash, 和 string-ci-hash are typically dependent on the current structure 和 contents of the input values 和 are thus unsuitable if keys are modified while they have associations in a hashtable.

procedure: (hashtable-set! hashtable key obj)

returns: unspecified

libraries: (rnrs hashtables), (rnrs)


hashtable must be a mutable hashtable. key should be an appropriate key for the hashtable's hash 和 equivalence functions. obj may be any Scheme object.

hashtable-set! associates key with obj in hashtable, replacing the existing association, if any.

(define ht (make-eq-hashtable))
(hashtable-set! ht 'a 73)

procedure: (hashtable-ref hashtable key default)

returns: see below

libraries: (rnrs hashtables), (rnrs)


key should be an appropriate key for the hashtable's hash 和 equivalence functions. default may be any Scheme object.

hashtable-ref returns the value associated with key in hashtable. If no value is associated with key in hashtable, hashtable-ref returns default.

(define p1 (cons 'a 'b))
(define p2 (cons 'a 'b))

(define eqht (make-eq-hashtable))
(hashtable-set! eqht p1 73)
(hashtable-ref eqht p1 55) => 73
(hashtable-ref eqht p2 55) => 55

(define equalht (make-hashtable equal-hash equal?))
(hashtable-set! equalht p1 73)
(hashtable-ref equalht p1 55) => 73
(hashtable-ref equalht p2 55) => 73

procedure: (hashtable-contains? hashtable key)

returns: #t if an association for key exists in hashtable, #f otherwise

libraries: (rnrs hashtables), (rnrs)


key should be an appropriate key for the hashtable's hash 和 equivalence functions.

(define ht (make-eq-hashtable))
(define p1 (cons 'a 'b))
(define p2 (cons 'a 'b))
(hashtable-set! ht p1 73)
(hashtable-contains? ht p1) => #t
(hashtable-contains? ht p2) => #f

procedure: (hashtable-update! hashtable key procedure default)

returns: unspecified

libraries: (rnrs hashtables), (rnrs)


hashtable must be a mutable hashtable. key should be an appropriate key for the hashtable's hash 和 equivalence functions. default may be any Scheme object. procedure should accept one argument, should return one value, 和 should not modify hashtable.

hashtable-update! applies procedure to the value associated with key in hashtable, or to default if no value is associated with key in hashtable. If procedure returns, hashtable-update! associates key with the value returned by procedure, replacing the old association, if any.

A version of hashtable-update! that does not verify that it receives arguments of the proper type might be defined as follows.

(define hashtable-update!
  (lambda (ht key proc value)
    (hashtable-set! ht key
      (proc (hashtable-ref ht key value)))))

An implementation may, however, be able to implement hashtable-update! more efficiently by avoiding multiple hash computations 和 hashtable lookups.

(define ht (make-eq-hashtable))
(hashtable-update! ht 'a
  (lambda (x) (* x 2))
  55)
(hashtable-ref ht 'a 0) => 110
(hashtable-update! ht 'a
  (lambda (x) (* x 2))
  0)
(hashtable-ref ht 'a 0) => 220

procedure: (hashtable-delete! hashtable key)

returns: unspecified

libraries: (rnrs hashtables), (rnrs)


hashtable must be a mutable hashtable. key should be an appropriate key for the hashtable's hash 和 equivalence functions.

hashtable-delete! drops any association for key from hashtable.

(define ht (make-eq-hashtable))
(define p1 (cons 'a 'b))
(define p2 (cons 'a 'b))
(hashtable-set! ht p1 73)
(hashtable-contains? ht p1) => #t
(hashtable-delete! ht p1)
(hashtable-contains? ht p1) => #f
(hashtable-contains? ht p2) => #f
(hashtable-delete! ht p2)

procedure: (hashtable-size hashtable)

returns: number of entries in hashtable

libraries: (rnrs hashtables), (rnrs)


(define ht (make-eq-hashtable))
(define p1 (cons 'a 'b))
(define p2 (cons 'a 'b))
(hashtable-size ht) => 0
(hashtable-set! ht p1 73)
(hashtable-size ht) => 1
(hashtable-delete! ht p1)
(hashtable-size ht) => 0

procedure: (hashtable-copy hashtable)

procedure: (hashtable-copy hashtable mutable?)

returns: a new hashtable containing the same entries as hashtable

libraries: (rnrs hashtables), (rnrs)


If mutable? is present 和 not false, the copy is mutable; otherwise, the copy is immutable.

(define ht (make-eq-hashtable))
(define p1 (cons 'a 'b))
(hashtable-set! ht p1 "c")
(define ht-copy (hashtable-copy ht))
(hashtable-mutable? ht-copy) => #f
(hashtable-delete! ht p1)
(hashtable-ref ht p1 #f) => #f
(hashtable-delete! ht-copy p1) => exception: not mutable
(hashtable-ref ht-copy p1 #f) => "c"

procedure: (hashtable-clear! hashtable)

procedure: (hashtable-clear! hashtable size)

returns: unspecified

libraries: (rnrs hashtables), (rnrs)


hashtable must be a mutable hashtable. If size is provided, it must be a nonnegative exact integer.

hashtable-clear! removes all entries from hashtable. If size is provided, the hashtable is reset to the given size, as if newly created by one of the hashtable creation operations with size argument size.

(define ht (make-eq-hashtable))
(define p1 (cons 'a 'b))
(define p2 (cons 'a 'b))
(hashtable-set! ht p1 "first")
(hashtable-set! ht p2 "second")
(hashtable-size ht) => 2
(hashtable-clear! ht)
(hashtable-size ht) => 0
(hashtable-ref ht p1 #f) => #f

procedure: (hashtable-keys hashtable)

returns: a vector containing the keys in hashtable

libraries: (rnrs hashtables), (rnrs)


The keys may appear in any order in the returned vector.

(define ht (make-eq-hashtable))
(define p1 (cons 'a 'b))
(define p2 (cons 'a 'b))
(hashtable-set! ht p1 "one")
(hashtable-set! ht p2 "two")
(hashtable-set! ht 'q "three")
(hashtable-keys ht) => #((a . b) q (a . b))

procedure: (hashtable-entries hashtable)

returns: two vectors: one of keys 和 a second of values

libraries: (rnrs hashtables), (rnrs)


hashtable-entries returns two values. The first is a vector containing the keys in hashtable, 和 the second is a vector containing the corresponding values. The keys 和 values may appear in any order, but the order is the same for the keys 和 for the corresponding values.

(define ht (make-eq-hashtable))
(define p1 (cons 'a 'b))
(define p2 (cons 'a 'b))
(hashtable-set! ht p1 "one")
(hashtable-set! ht p2 "two")
(hashtable-set! ht 'q "three")
(hashtable-entries ht) => #((a . b) q (a . b))
                        #("two" "three" "one")

** Section 6.14. Enumerations

Enumerations are ordered sets of symbols, typically used to name 和 manipulate options, as with the buffer modes 和 file options that may be specified when files are created.

syntax: (define-enumeration name (symbol ...) constructor)

libraries: (rnrs enums), (rnrs)


A define-enumeration form is a definition 和 can appear anywhere any other definition can appear.

The define-enumeration syntax creates a new enumeration set with the specified symbols in the specified order forming the enumeration's universe. It defines a new syntactic form named by name that may be used to verify that a symbol is in the universe. If x is in the universe, (name x) evaluates to x. It is a syntax violation if x is not in the universe.

define-enumeration also defines a new syntactic form named by constructor that may be used to create subsets of the enumeration type. If x ... are each in the universe, (constructor x ...) evaluates to an enumeration set containing x .... Otherwise, it is a syntax violation. The same symbol may appear more than once in x ..., but the resulting set contains only one occurrence of the symbol.

(define-enumeration weather-element
  (hot warm cold sunny rainy snowy windy)
  weather)

(weather-element hot) => hot
(weather-element fun) => syntax violation
(weather hot sunny windy) => #<enum-set>
(enum-set->list (weather rainy cold rainy)) => (cold rainy)

procedure: (make-enumeration symbol-list)

returns: an enumeration set

libraries: (rnrs enums), (rnrs)


This procedure creates a new enumeration type whose universe comprises the elements of symbol-list, which must be a list of symbols, in the order of their first appearance in the list. It returns the universe of the new enumeration type as an enumeration set.

(define positions (make-enumeration '(top bottom above top beside)))
(enum-set->list positions) => (top bottom above beside)

procedure: (enum-set-constructor enum-set)

returns: an enumeration-set construction procedure

libraries: (rnrs enums), (rnrs)


This procedure returns a procedure p that may be used to create subsets of the universe of enum-set. p must be passed a list of symbols, 和 each element of the list must be an element of the universe of enum-set. The enumeration set returned by p contains all 和 only the symbols in the list it is passed. The value returned by p may contain elements not in enum-set if the universe of enum-set contains those elements.

(define e1 (make-enumeration '(one two three four)))
(define p1 (enum-set-constructor e1))
(define e2 (p1 '(one three)))
(enum-set->list e2) => (one three)
(define p2 (enum-set-constructor e2))
(define e3 (p2 '(one two four)))
(enum-set->list e3) => (one two four)

procedure: (enum-set-universe enum-set)

returns: the universe of enum-set, as an enumeration set

libraries: (rnrs enums), (rnrs)


(define e1 (make-enumeration '(a b c a b c d)))
(enum-set->list (enum-set-universe e1)) => (a b c d)
(define e2 ((enum-set-constructor e1) '(c)))
(enum-set->list (enum-set-universe e2)) => (a b c d)

procedure: (enum-set->list enum-set)

returns: a list of the elements of enum-set

libraries: (rnrs enums), (rnrs)


The symbols in the resulting list appear in the order given to them when the enumeration type of enum-set was created.

(define e1 (make-enumeration '(a b c a b c d)))
(enum-set->list e1) => (a b c d)
(define e2 ((enum-set-constructor e1) '(d c a b)))
(enum-set->list e2) => (a b c d)

procedure: (enum-set-subset? enum-set1 enum-set2)

returns: #t if enum-set1 is a subset of enum-set2, #f otherwise

libraries: (rnrs enums), (rnrs)


An enumeration set enum-set1 is a subset of an enumeration set enum-set2 if 和 only if the universe of enum-set1 is a subset of the universe of enum-set2 和 each element of enum-set1 is an element of enum-set2.

(define e1 (make-enumeration '(a b c)))
(define e2 (make-enumeration '(a b c d e)))
(enum-set-subset? e1 e2) => #t
(enum-set-subset? e2 e1) => #f
(define e3 ((enum-set-constructor e2) '(a c)))
(enum-set-subset? e3 e1) => #f
(enum-set-subset? e3 e2) => #t

procedure: (enum-set=? enum-set1 enum-set2)

returns: #t if enum-set1 和 enum-set2 are equivalent, #f otherwise

libraries: (rnrs enums), (rnrs)


Two enumeration sets enum-set1 和 enum-set2 are equivalent if each is a subset of the other.

(define e1 (make-enumeration '(a b c d)))
(define e2 (make-enumeration '(b d c a)))
(enum-set=? e1 e2) => #t
(define e3 ((enum-set-constructor e1) '(a c)))
(define e4 ((enum-set-constructor e2) '(a c)))
(enum-set=? e3 e4) => #t
(enum-set=? e3 e2) => #f

enum-set=? could be defined in terms of enum-set-subset? as follows.

(define enum-set=?
  (lambda (e1 e2)
    (和 (enum-set-subset? e1 e2) (enum-set-subset? e2 e1))))

procedure: (enum-set-member? symbol enum-set)

returns: #t if symbol is an element of enum-set, #f otherwise

libraries: (rnrs enums), (rnrs)


(define e1 (make-enumeration '(a b c d e)))
(define e2 ((enum-set-constructor e1) '(d b)))
(enum-set-member? 'c e1) => #t
(enum-set-member? 'c e2) => #f

procedure: (enum-set-union enum-set1 enum-set2)

returns: the union of enum-set1 和 enum-set2

procedure: (enum-set-intersection enum-set1 enum-set2)

returns: the intersection of enum-set1 和 enum-set2

procedure: (enum-set-difference enum-set1 enum-set2)

returns: the difference of enum-set1 和 enum-set2

libraries: (rnrs enums), (rnrs)


enum-set1 和 enum-set2 must have the same enumeration type. Each procedure returns a new enumeration set representing the union, intersection, or difference of the two sets.

(define e1 (make-enumeration '(a b c d)))
(define e2 ((enum-set-constructor e1) '(a c)))
(define e3 ((enum-set-constructor e1) '(b c)))
(enum-set->list (enum-set-union e2 e3)) => (a b c)

(enum-set->list (enum-set-complement e1)) => ()
(define e2 ((enum-set-constructor e1) '(a c)))
(enum-set->list (enum-set-complement e2)) => (b d)

procedure: (enum-set-projection enum-set1 enum-set2)

returns: the projection of enum-set1 into the universe of enum-set2

libraries: (rnrs enums), (rnrs)


Any elements of enum-set1 not in the universe of enum-set2 are dropped. The result is of the same enumeration type as enum-set2.

(define e1 (make-enumeration '(a b c d)))
(define e2 (make-enumeration '(a b c d e f g)))
(define e3 ((enum-set-constructor e1) '(a d)))
(define e4 ((enum-set-constructor e2) '(a c e g)))
(enum-set->list (enum-set-projection e4 e3)) => (a c)
(enum-set->list
  (enum-set-union e3
    (enum-set-projection e4 e3))) => (a c d)

procedure: (enum-set-indexer enum-set)

returns: a procedure that returns the index of a symbol in the universe of enum-set

libraries: (rnrs enums), (rnrs)


enum-set-indexer returns a procedure p that, when applied to a symbol in the universe of enum-set, returns the index of the symbol (zero-based) in the ordered set of symbols that form the universe. If applied to a symbol not in the universe, p returns #f.

(define e1 (make-enumeration '(a b c d)))
(define e2 ((enum-set-constructor e1) '(a d)))
(define p (enum-set-indexer e2))
(list (p 'a) (p 'c) (p 'e)) => (0 2 #f)
